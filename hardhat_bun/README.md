# Hardhat + Bun Project Setup Script

With this script, developers can quickly start working on their blockchain projects without manually configuring the environment. The inclusion of demo files and a predefined directory structure simplifies learning and experimentation, making it an excellent tool for both beginners and experienced developers.


This Bash script automates the creation of a complete Hardhat project integrated with Bun, providing a seamless environment for Ethereum smart contract development. It initializes the project structure, installs necessary dependencies, and generates demo Solidity contracts, migration scripts, and test files. Additionally, it sets up essential configuration files like `.gitignore`, `.env`, and `README.md` to ensure a ready-to-use development setup.
